# EMA: OOP application of principles and concepts

This program aim to protect the customers identity for the grecory online shopping. 
Passowrd is one of the main threats where bad actore mostly target to gain access in a system and steal personal infomration Hence in this porgram we will be implemeting four security steps to ensure passsowrd protection agains any attacks as following:

# Use of strong passwords with minimum 8 charactors. 



# Password complixcity to ensure upper case exists. 

In this updated code, we added a loop that prompts the user to enter a password until it meets the complexity requirements. The re.search function is used to check if the password contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character. If the password meets the complexity requirements, it is inserted into the users table using an SQL INSERT INTO statement.

# Password encryption 

In this updated code, we added the hashlib library to generate a SHA-256 hash of the user's password. The password.encode() method is used to convert the password from a string to a byte string, which is required by the hashlib library. The resulting hash is then stored in the password_hash column of the users table. Note that since a one-way hash function is used, it is not possible to retrieve the original password from the hash. When a user logs in, their input password will be hashed and compared with the stored hash to authenticate them.

# Multifactor Authentication
In this updated code, we added the pyotp library to generate a random MFA secret key and validate MFA codes. After the user enters their username and password, a random MFA secret key is generated using the pyotp.random_base32() function and stored in the mfa_secret column of the users table. The user is then prompted to set up MFA using their secret key and a QR code is displayed using the provisioning_uri() function. When the user logs in, they are prompted to enter their MFA code, which is then verified using the pyotp.TOTP() function and the stored MFA secret key. If the MFA code is valid, the user is authenticated.

To access the QR code generated by PyOTP, you can use a QR code scanner app on your smartphone or tablet. Here's an example of how to use the Google Authenticator app to scan the QR code and set up MFA:

Install the Google Authenticator app on your smartphone or tablet.
Run the Python code that generates the QR code and displays it in the console. The QR code should be displayed in the console as a PNG image.
Open the Google Authenticator app on your smartphone or tablet and tap the "+" button to add a new account.
Select "Scan a barcode" and point your camera at the QR code displayed in the console. The app should recognize the QR code and add a new account for your app.
The app should now display a 6-digit code that changes every 30 seconds. When you log in to your app, you'll need to enter this code along with your username, password, and MFA secret key.
